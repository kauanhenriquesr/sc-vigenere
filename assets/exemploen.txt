In a village hidden between mountains and dense forests, there lived an old watchmaker named Elias. He was known for fixing any kind of clock, from the simplest wristwatches to the most ancient and mysterious timepieces. But there was one clock, kept in a dusty dark wooden box, that he never let anyone touch.
They said that clock was magical.
One day, a girl named Clara entered the watch shop with a strange request.

— Mr. Elias, I want to go back in time.

The old man chuckled, as if he had heard that before.

— And why would you want that, little one?

— Because I said hurtful things to my grandmother before she passed. I want to tell her I love her.

The smile faded from Elias’s face. In silence, he walked to the back of the shop and returned with the wooden box. He placed it gently on the counter and opened it. Inside was a golden pocket watch, engraved with strange symbols.

— This is the Clock of Time. It can take you to a specific moment, but only once. After that, it breaks forever. Choose wisely.

Clara held the watch with trembling hands. She thought of her grandmother — the smell of cornbread, the bedtime stories, the warm embrace. She turned the dial to the date she wanted and, in the blink of an eye, disappeared.

She returned to the afternoon of that sad day. She ran to her grandmother’s house and hugged her tightly, saying all the words she had kept in her heart. They laughed, they cried, and for a moment, time stood still.

When Clara came back to the present, the watch in her hand was cracked. Elias was waiting by the door.

— Did it work?

— Yes, Clara said, smiling with tears in her eyes.

The watchmaker nodded, carefully placed the broken pieces in a drawer, and returned to his work.

From that day on, Clara visited Elias whenever she could. And in every visit, she heard a new story about time — and learned that although we can't always change it, we can choose how we use it now.
